Dear Recruiter,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Python Software Developer Intern position in New York.  I would be thrilled to have the opportunity of working at GP Energy Management over the summer.  After reviewing the job listing on LinkedIn, this position seems like a great opportunity for myself, and I believe that the skills and experiences I have gained, in and out of school, will make me a competitive candidate for the job.  I’m sending this with my application and resume in hopes that you will consider me for this position, and that I will get the opportunity to contribute my knowledge towards bettering the company.

I am currently a student athlete studying Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Through my coursework and experiences at RPI, I have developed a wealth of knowledge of complex algorithms, data structures, and good programming design.  This, along with the experience I gained as an intern last summer at Intelligent Data Systems, gives me confidence that I will be able to excel and take ownership of any project given to me.  Further, the strong communication skills I possess make me a useful and collaborative team member.   Most importantly, my previous experiences along with strong analytical skills have allowed me how to apply what I already know to new situations.  Sometimes solutions come from unexpected places, and I’m the type of creative problem-solver and quick learner to excel at whatever challenges come my way.  I hope to be able to apply these skills and this knowledge to develop effective solutions for GP Energy Management.

After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for.  I would love a chance to meet and discuss the job opportunity, as well as my qualifications.  Please feel free to contact me using the contact information provided above.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
