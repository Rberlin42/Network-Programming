***SUPPORTS IPv6***

Some specific server behavior:

- if a new user enters a nickname already in use, it is sent the error message 
  "Invalid command, please identify yourself with USER.", and is disconnected

- if a client disconnects abnormally (without using QUIT), all other users are notified
  as if the client did normally use QUIT

- Commands must have the exact amount of arguments.  If a command is given with extra
  arguments it is treated as an invalid command.  (ex. LIST #netprog foo)

- If a user tries to join a channel that they are already in, it is ignored
- If a user tries to part a channel that they are not in (or that doesn't exist),
  an error message is sent
- If a user calls PART with no arguments, and is not currently in any channels,
  it is ignored

- If there is no password set and operator is called, the following error message is returned:
  "Operator status not available."

- If a user tries to send a message to a nonexistant user, the following error is returned:
  "<user> is not on the server."  

- If a user tries to use KICK without being an operator, the following error is returned:
  "You must have OPERATOR status."
- If a user tries to KICK a nonexistant user, the following error is returned:
  "<user> is not on the server."  
- If a user is kicked from a channel they are not in (or doesn't exist), an error messege is sent
